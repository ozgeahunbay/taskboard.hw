# taskboard.hw

In this homework, I created a dashboard to keep track of tasks. A user can enter a task name, due date, and description. The task card will be white if there is time to complete it, yellow if the date is approaching, and red if the task is overdue. the user can then drag and drop the tasks cared to to-do status, in progress status, or done status. The user can also delete the task when they are finished with it.
